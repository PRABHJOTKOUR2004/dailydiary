Train-Test Split
  Work Done: Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.
Why/How: Ensures the model is trained on one portion of data and tested on unseen data to evaluate performance.
Learned: Prevents overfitting and ensures realistic evaluation metrics.

Code:
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
