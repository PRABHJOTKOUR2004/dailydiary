Accuracy Measurement

Work Done: Calculated accuracy: (Correct predictions / Total predictions).
Why/How: Gives a general measure of model performance.
Learned: Accuracy alone is not enough for imbalanced datasets.

Code:
  from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
