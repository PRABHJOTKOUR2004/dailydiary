Model Training
  Work Done: Trained the model using the training dataset.
Why/How: Model learns patterns from labeled spam and ham messages.
Learned: Training is where the model “understands” the relationship between words and labels.

Code:
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
